## Publications and academic writing 

* I wrote a post on the blog of Digital Humanities Group at FBK <a href="https://dh.fbk.eu/2021/02/discriminazioni-algoritmiche-tra-pregiudizi-umani-e-decisioni-automatiche/" target="_blank">Algorithmic discrimination, between human biases and automatic decisions</a>, at the end of the internship there. It was really a chance to refocus and discover how passionate I am about these topics (it's in Italian, sooner or later I will translate it)
