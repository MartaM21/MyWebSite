## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_pict.jpg">

Hi! I am Marta Marchiori Manerba, Master's student of **Digital Humanities** at University of Pisa, Italy :)

## Research Interests

NLP; XAI; Fairness in ML; Algorithmic bias; Algorithmic Auditing; Digital Discrimination

## Publications and academic writing 

1. I wrote a post on the blog of Digital Humanities Group at FBK [*Algorithmic discrimination, between human biases and automatic decisions*](https://dh.fbk.eu/2021/02/discriminazioni-algoritmiche-tra-pregiudizi-umani-e-decisioni-automatiche/), at the end of the internship there. It was really a chance to refocus and discover how passionate I am about these topics (it's in Italian, sooner or later I will translate it)
